# To-Do List Manager

A simple and fully functional To-Do List Manager built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app allows users to add, edit, delete, mark tasks as completed, filter tasks, search tasks, and reorder them. It uses **localStorage** to persist tasks across page reloads.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Add a task by typing in the input field and clicking "Add Task".
- **Edit Tasks**: Edit a task in place by clicking the "Edit" button next to the task.
- **Delete Tasks**: Delete a task from the list by clicking the "Delete" button.
- **Complete Tasks**: Mark a task as completed, which will strike through the task text.
- **Filter Tasks**: Filter tasks to show all, completed, or pending tasks.
- **Search Tasks**: Search tasks by name in real-time.
- **Drag and Drop Reordering**: Reorder tasks by dragging and dropping.
- **Persistence**: All tasks are saved in `localStorage`, so they persist across page reloads.
